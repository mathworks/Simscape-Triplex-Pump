%% Joint Limits and Friction Methods in a Hinge
% 
% This example shows three methods of extending Simscape Multibody models
% with additional physical effects using Simscape.  Review the three
% methods below to determine which method is best suited to your needs.
%
% The mechanical system is a hinge modeled with a revolute joint.  The
% range of joint motion can be limited directly in Simscape Multibody joint
% blocks starting in R2019a. Hard stops and friction are added to the joint
% in the other models.  At the start of simulation, gravity pulls the
% second link down, rotating the hinge to its limit.  The friction and
% joint limit affect how the system behaves.
%
% For all methods, the position and orientation of the two frames connected
% to the joint must be coordinated with the limits set in the hard stop.

set_param(find_system('sm_ssci_hinge_hardstop','FindAll', 'on','type','annotation','Tag','ModelFeatures'),'Interpreter','off')

%% Foundation Library Method
% This method is easily assembled using Foundation library elements.
% However, position information from the Revolute Joint is not communicated
% to the Simscape network. This is only an issue for blocks such as the
% hard stop block which need the initial position of the joint. For this
% method, a MATLAB variable is used to set the initial position in the
% Revolute Joint and the Hard Stop block.
%
% Simscape Physical Signals are used to connect the Simscape Multibody
% Joint and the Simscape 1D mechanical blocks.  No algebraic loop is
% created and the equations from both models are solved simultaneously. To
% use this method, set Actuation-->Torque to "Provided by Input" and enable
% velocity sensing within the Revolute Joint block.
%
% Interface from Foundation Library:

open_system('fl_lib/Mechanical/Multibody Interfaces','force')

%% Joint Actuation Method
% This method communicates position and velocity information to the
% Simscape blocks used to implement the physical effect. The blocks used
% here are custom Simscape blocks that use the same equations as in the
% Foundation library.  The code is open and can be modified.

% Joint to the custom Simscape blocks.  No algebraic loop is created and
% the equations from both portions of the model are solved simultaneously. To
% use this method, set Actuation-->Torque to "Provided by Input" and enable
% position and velocity sensing within the Revolute Joint block.

%% Transform Sensor Method
% This method communicates position and velocity information to the
% Simscape blocks used to implement the physical effect. The blocks used
% here are custom Simscape blocks that use the same equations as in the
% Foundation library.  The code is open and can be modified. 
%
% An advantage of this method is that it does not require adjusting
% settings within the joint block, which makes it easy to add and remove.
% However, the mathematical operations prescribed by the joint are not
% reused in this configuration, so there is a small additional mathematical
% cost to this method.
